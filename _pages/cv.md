Education
======
* B.S. in Electrical Engineering, Texas A&M University, 2025
* Relevant Coursework: FPGA Information Processing Systems, Computer Architecture and Design, Fundamentals of Networking, Intro to VLSI System Design, Digital Integrated Circuit Design, Electronics, Signals and Systems
  
Work experience
======
* Summer 2024: HPE Hardware Intern
  * 

* Fall 2023 - Summer 2024: Research Assistant
  * Texas A&M University
  * Assisted in the development a Verilog to GDSii flow script by collaborating with graduate researchers to use OpenROAD to assess power efficiency, logic synthesis, placement, floor planning, and timing analysis in order to optimize the automation process, with the eventual goal of creating an open-source automated RTL to GDSii software that is more universal for FPGA and ASIC applications by contributing a dataset of various Verilog circuits generated on OpenROAD
  
Organizations
======
* Texas A&M Solar Racing Team
    * Power Distribution Team
      * Collaborated with various teams to design a comprehensive diagram showing the distribution of power for the car and how it should be wired, resulting in optimal functionality and seamless implementation.
      * Rewiring the entire car and soldering components together using my diagram as reference to ensure the car is able to run once every part is connected together.
      * Manufactured a PCB that is coupled with a Buck converter in order to distribute different voltage values throughout the vehicle based on the requirements needed for every component.
