Education
======
* B.S. in Electrical Engineering, Texas A&M University, 2025
* Relevant Coursework: FPGA Information Processing Systems, Computer Architecture and Design, Fundamentals of Networking, Intro to VLSI System Design, Digital Integrated Circuit Design, Electronics, Signals and Systems
  
Work experience
======
* Summer 2024: HPE Hardware Intern
  * 

* Fall 2023 - Summer 2024: Research Assistant
  * Assisted in the development a Verilog to GDSii flow script by collaborating with graduate researchers to use OpenROAD to assess power efficiency, logic synthesis, placement, floor planning, and timing analysis in order to optimize the automation process, with the eventual goal of creating an open-source automated RTL to GDSii software that is more universal for FPGA and ASIC applications by contributing a dataset of various Verilog circuits generated on OpenROAD

Projects
======
* Single Cycle Processor, May 2024
    * Applying understanding of every part of a simple processor, did a ground-up design of the ALU, Sign Extender, Data Memory, Instruction Memory, Program Counter logic, the Control, and the Register File.
    * Created a simple instruction set for the processor that includes both R-type and I-type Addition and Subtraction, bitwise AND, bitwise OR, load and store instructions, and MOV instructions.
    * Verified proper performance by designing test benches from scratch, and generated waveforms from the test to evaluate latency.

* MOSFET Amplifier Design, December 2023
    * Designed a multi-stage MOSFET amplifier consisting of resistors, capacitors, and MOSFETs to produce the ideal trend given on a specification sheet once powered by a power supply and a waveform generator.
    * Employed an oscilloscope and multimeter to measure impedance and gain to ensure proper performance on various AC voltage inputs. 
    * Utilized this amplifier to increase the magnitude of various AC voltage inputs for use on various circuits and developed a deep understanding of amplifiers while documenting the entire development process.


Organizations
======
* Texas A&M Solar Racing Team
    * Power Distribution Team
      * Collaborated with various teams to design a comprehensive diagram showing the distribution of power for the car and how it should be wired, resulting in optimal functionality and seamless implementation.
      * Rewiring the entire car and soldering components together using my diagram as reference to ensure the car is able to run once every part is connected together.
      * Manufactured a PCB that is coupled with a Buck converter in order to distribute different voltage values throughout the vehicle based on the requirements needed for every component.
