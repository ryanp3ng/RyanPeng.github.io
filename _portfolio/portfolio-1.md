<u>Lab 1</u><br>
Introduction to Cadence Design and Simulation<br>
Designed a gate-level full adder as shown: <br><img src = "RyanPeng.github.io/images/Lab1FA.PNG"><br> Then, by creating a Verilog test fixture, I was able to test the proper results for a full-adder with the results in the table below: <br><img src = "RyanPeng.github.io/images/Lab1FATest.PNG"><br> 
Then using that full adder, I created a four-bit adder and tested it as shown below: <br>

After, in order to create a 8-bit pipelined adder, I was to first design a 4-bit register as shown below: <br>

Then finally, I was able to create and test the 8-bit adder: <br>
